        <h1>TCP/IP</h1>
        <h2>What is TCP?</h2>
        <p>TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol, a communications standard that enables application programs and computing devices to exchange messages over a network. It is designed to send packets across the internet and ensure the successful delivery of data and messages over networks</p>
        <p>TCP is one of the basic standards that define the rules of the internet and is included within the standards defined by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF). It is one of the most commonly used protocols within digital network communications and ensures end-to-end data delivery.</p>
        <p>TCP organizes data so that it can be transmitted between a server and a client. It guarantees teh integrity of the data being communicated over a network. Before it transmits data, TCP establishes a connection between a source and its destination, which it ensures remains live until communication begins. It then breaks large amounts of data into smaller packets, while ensuring data integrity is in place throughout the process.</p>
        <h2>What is IP</h2>
        <p>The Internet Protocol (IP) is the method for sending data from one device to another across the internet. Every device has an IP address that uniquely identifies it and enables it to communicate with and exchange data with other devices connected to the internet.</p>
        <p>IP is responsible for defining how applications and devices exchange packets of data and with each other. It is the principal communications protocol responsible for the formats and rules for exchanging data and messages between computers on a single network or several internet-connected networks. It does this through the Internet Protocol Suite (TCP/IP), a group of communications protocols that are split into four abstraction layers.</p>
        <p>IP is the main protocol within the internet layer of the TCP?IP. Its main purpose is to deliver data packets between the source application or device and the destination using methods and structures that place tags, such as address information, with data packets.</p>
        <h2>TCP vs IP: What is the Difference?</h2>
        <p>TCP and IP are separate protocols that work together to ensure data is delivered to its intended destination within a network. IP obtains and the defines the address--teh IP address--of the application or device the data must be sent to. TCP is then responsible for transporting and routing data through the network architecture and ensuring it gets delivered to the destination application or device that IP has defined.</p>
        <p>In other words, the IP address is akin to a phone number assigned to a smartphone. TCP is the computer networking version of the technology used to make the smartphone ring and enable its user to talk to the person who called them. The two protocols are frequently used together and rely on each other for data to have a destination and safely reach it, which is why the process is regularly referred to as TCP/IP.</p>
