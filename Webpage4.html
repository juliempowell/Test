        <h1>Autonomous Systems</h1>
        <h2>What is an autonomous system?</h2>
        <p>The internet is a network of networks and autonomous systems (AS) are the big networks that make up the internet. In other words, an AS is a collection of one or more associated Internet Protocol (IP) prefixes with a clearly defined routing policy that governs how the AS exchanges routing information with other autonomous systems. An AS routing policy is a list of the IP address space that the AS controls, plus a list of the other ASes to which it connects. This information is necessary for routing packets to the correct networks</p>
        <h2>The three kinds of autonomous systems</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Multi-homed: Interconnects multiple external autonomous systems</li>
                <li>Transit: Acts as a link between multiple external autonomous systems</li>
                <li>Single-homed (stub): Interconnects with only a single external autonomous system</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
