        <h1>BGP - The Backbone of the Internet</h1>
<p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP is classified as a path-vector routing protocol, and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator.</p>
<p>When someone drops a letter into a mailbox, the Postal Service processes that piece of mail and chooses a fast, efficient route to deliver that letter to its recipient. Similarly, when someone submits data via the Internet, <strong>BGP is responsible for looking at all of the available paths</strong> that data could travel and <em>picking the best route,</em> which usually means hopping between autonomous systems.</p>
