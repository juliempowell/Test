        <h1>BGP - The Backbone of the Internet</h1>
<p>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is a standardized exterior gateway protocol designed to exchange routing and reachability information among autonomous systems (AS) on the Internet. BGP is classified as a path-vector routing protocol, and it makes routing decisions based on paths, network policies, or rule-sets configured by a network administrator.</p>
<p>When someone drops a letter into a mailbox, the Postal Service processes that piece of mail and chooses a fast, efficient route to deliver that letter to its recipient. Similarly, when someone submits data via the Internet, <strong>BGP is responsible for looking at all of the available paths</strong> that data could travel and <em>picking the best route,</em> which usually means hopping between autonomous systems.</p>
<br />
<h2>What is an Autonomous System?</h2>
<p>If we continue to think of BGP as the Postal Service of the Internet, each AS is like an individual post office branch. A town may have hundreds of mailboxes, but the mail in those boxes must go through the local postal branch before being routed to another destination. The internal routers within an AS are like mailboxes. They forward their outbound transmissions to the AS, which then uses BGP routing to get these transmissions to their destinations.</p>
